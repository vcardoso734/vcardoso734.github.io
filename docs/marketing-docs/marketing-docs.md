# Marketing Docs

In the pages below, you'll find some examples of marketing material that I've created over the course of my career.

I define marketing material as content that's intended to promote a company's services or inform its customer base, usually in the form of an email, newsletter, or blog post. However, it can also be a piece of content delivered by salespeople to potential customers.
