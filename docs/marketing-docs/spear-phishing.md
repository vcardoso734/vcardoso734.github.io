You’ve probably heard the term “phishing” before. It’s an attempt to steal sensitive information (like usernames, passwords, or credit cards) by pretending to be a trustworthy source, usually by email. Well, you need to know about something called “spear phishing,” because it’s even more sinister, and it shows how smart cybercriminals are becoming.

With regular phishing, a scammer might cast a broad net, sending emails to hundreds of thousands of users to catch a handful that fall for it. Spear phishing is much, much more sophisticated: it’s a very specific attack against a company or individual. It’s the topic of this post because one of our clients recently experienced it, and the reason we're sharing it is because the attack was, quite simply, both brilliant and frightening.

The client, Acme America (whose name has been changed to protect the innocent), received an email from someone asking for an invoice to be paid. It was signed “Andy” and the return address was [andy@acmeameriica.com](mailto:andy@acmeameriica.com). Did you catch that? You might have thought it was a typo, but it wasn’t. This hacker registered a domain name that was **virtually identical to the name of the client**, only with an extra “i” in “America.” Then the scammer actually **emailed someone within Acme America who was responsible for invoicing**.

Now, with a small shop of only 5-10 people, you’d know if there was an Andy or not. But how about a company of 100 or 200? The recipient most likely would have done further checking before paying such a bill (we can hope!), but they might have opened an attached “invoice,” at least to have a look at it. And who knows what that “invoice” could have actually been.

Spear phishing attacks are somewhat rare, but they can be very effective. They’re usually orchestrated by government-sponsored hackers or hacktivists that spend a lot of time engineering an approach that’s designed to fool someone within a company. Usually, the end goal is to resell sensitive information to other governments or private companies. 

Because of how tailored spear phishing is, it’s not easy to catch. What are the most effective tools to combat it? 

- **Education.** You have to teach employees (especially high-ranking executives and those dealing with sensitive data) that they might get sophisticated, fraudulent emails in their inbox.
- **Email-Specific Security Technology.** It’s not enough to have backups here. Invest in tools that specifically focus on email to help thwart spear phishing attacks.

As for Acme America, thankfully they realized that something was out of place and reported the problem to our company. We went ahead and implemented some new security procedures and contacted the registrar of the domain to get it shut down. This prevented any further emails coming from acmeameriica.com.

So now you know about spear phishing. Take this information and find a way to protect yourself against it. You might not be 100% successful, but it’s important to learn about the new ways scammers are devising to trick you into revealing sensitive information. And as the saying goes: “Knowledge is power.”
