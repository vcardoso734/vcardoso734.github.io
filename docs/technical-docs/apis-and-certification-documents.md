# APIs and Certification Documents

| About this example                                           |

| *Unfortunately, I am unable to share examples of API and certification documents produced for a former employer in the quick service restaurant industry. That documentation is not public and is considered confidential. I can, however, share high-level information about the deliverables I created.<br /><br />Tools used: MS-Word, Adobe Acrobat, SnagIt, Confluence, Hyper-V* |


## Remote Store API

The Remote Store API is a programmatic interface that exists between local store point-of-sale (POS) systems and above store enterprise systems. It enables two key pieces of functionality:

1. The ability to send orders placed online (or via a mobile app) to the appropriate local store to fulfill.
2. The ability to ask for pricing details from the local store where the order will be fulfilled. Because of local regulations, taxes, and approved variances, product prices can differ from market to market (or even individual stores in different cities).

The API is updated whenever new functionality is added to the POS system. I was responsible for documenting and testing new API endpoints and parameters for every release using a proprietary tool developed by the company.

## Real-Time Data API

Metrics are an important part of all current enterprise systems. I created the first official real-time data API documentation that described how metrics were passed back and forth between the local store and above store systems. These metrics included: how long it took to complete orders, the average price of orders, and how those metrics compared to the previous day, week, and year.

## Ecommerce API

Every businesses with an online presence needs to have a means to collect payment. I gathered documentation from the company's initial ecommerce integration (which had taken place years before my arrival) and put together a comprehensive resource that talked about payment gateways, payment processors, and the events and responses that were passed between them.

There was also documentation on how to create a payment plugin for different payment gateways, in case a franchisee in an international market wanted to integrate with a different payment processor.

## NF525 Certification

In 2016, France passed a Finance Act which required all POS systems operating within the country to track sales transactions and produce logs at different points during a sales transaction. The logs were to be preserved for several years and be made available for government audit (when requested).

This required new functionality within the POS and documentation to accompany it. I created a 150-page NF525 certification document that contained system diagrams, payment flows, and descriptions of the new functionality that met the government's stringent requirements.

I was recognized for the quality of the document not only by my employer, but by the certification agency.
