# About Victor Cardoso

When it comes to getting the job done right, you need a documentation guru with a broad skillset (hint: that's me). My technical acumen and experience in the software industry means that I know what needs to be done and how to do it.

I've worn many hats throughout my career -- from marketing specialist to trainer to product manager. That experience lets me write for a technical audience, evangelize new products to developers and business partners, and train average end users on new software.

I'm a Northeasterner transplanted to the Midwest. When not working, I enjoy watching and reading science fiction, working on house projects, and exploring my hometown's culinary delights.
