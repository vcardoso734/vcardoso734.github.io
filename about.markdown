# About Victor Cardoso

What can I say? I'm a Northeasterner transplanted to the Midwest. That sentence goes a long way in describing my sense of humor and outlook on life. I've lived in Michigan for many years and have a career history that's just as long.

I've historically worked for companies that create software products. I've worn the hats of a trainer, product manager, evangelist, and technical writer.

I'm adept at managing and creating content for a number of different user profiles: from developers to information technology specialists to end-users. I've also been recognized for my excellent presentation and facilitation skills.

When not working, I enjoy watching and reading science fiction, working on house projects, and exploring my hometown's culinary delights.
