# Jekyll Site

| About this example                                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| *I created this site in 2021 as a means to highlight my work and to test the GitHub Pages feature.<br /><br />Tools used: Adobe Photoshop, Typora, Ruby, Markdown, Git, Jekyll, macOS, Command Line* |

This web site is served via GitHub Pages, a service offered by the GitHub internet service provider. GitHub offers web-based version control repositories using the Git software tool.

## The process

### Installation

1. I created a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository and cloned it locally to my M1 Mac mini.
2. Using the command line, I installed [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) in order to get the latest version of the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language.
3. I then installed the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) open source static site generator and found a free documentation theme that I liked: [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/).

### Authoring

I took existing documentation from my portfolio and converted it into the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language using [Typora](https://typora.io), a simple, elegant code editor. Images were created, converted, and edited using Adobe Photoshop.

### Publishing

I made changes in my local Git repository and pushed it to a Git staging branch before commiting it to the main branch for display.
