# Ransomware: How to Avoid Paying Hackers For Your Own Data

| About this example                                           |

| *This article was written in 2014 for a small IT company in Michigan. I authored it under the name of the business owner for a B2B newsletter distributed to dental practices in the United States.<br /><br />Tools used: MS-Word* |

All dental practices know the saying "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." Ben Franklin's the author, and it’s good advice for anyone who wants to avoid a toothache. That saying, however, applies to any number of situations, and I’m about to tell you why.

Let’s start with some recent headlines: “[Forty Million Target Customers Affected By Data Breach](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyclay/2013/12/18/millions-of-target-customers-likely-affected-by-data-breach/)”[1]; “Cyber Attack Could Cost Sony Studio As Much As $100 Million [2]"; and “[Hackers Penetrate West Wing Computer Network](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3066787/U-S-Senate-panel-raises-privacy-concerns-White-House-hacking-incident.html) [3].” As a consumer, you’ve probably worried about your personal data and what losing control of it might cost you. As a small business owner, have you given it any serious thought? After all, what’s the real possibility that a hacker group would target the data stored on your servers? 

Well, the reality is that you’re at risk from the same threats that all businesses face: viruses and malware. And a new trend in viruses might just cost you more than slow computers and spam: it might ask you to fork over cold, hard cash. Welcome to the phenomenon known as ransomware.

**It’s Digital Blackmail**

It sounds like a crazy plot in soap operas or late-night science fiction, but ransomware is real and has already caused significant damage. One version of ransomware was estimated at [collecting more than $27 million from its victims](https://www.secureworks.com/research/cryptowall-ransomware) [4].

It’s a new category of malware defined by a simple business model: a virus infects a workstation and then demands that a ransom be paid to its creators (usually in the form of a hard-to-trace cyber payment). Some versions simply lock the system and display a message, others are more sinister and encrypt your files with unbreakable cryptography. It’s digital blackmail, pure and simple.

**A Brief History** 

Believe it or not, ransomware is not new. One of the first known instances occurred in 1989 with a piece of software called PC Cyborg Trojan. Created by a Harvard-trained anthropologist and World Health Organization (WHO) consultant, the virus encrypted a user’s hard drive and masqueraded as an expired software license. Users were asked to “renew” their license by sending money to a PO Box located in Panama. If there’s any upside to the current crop of ransomware, it’s that you don’t have to go to the post office to buy a stamp!

Since then, ransomware appearances have only increased. In 2006, there was Krotten. This malware inserted Russian profanity throughout a computer’s user interface and disabled files in the Windows directory. WinLock arrived in 2010 and locked users out of the system, displaying lewd images on the screen until a code was purchased. And Reveton, in 2012, went so far as to impersonate a law enforcement agency, informing users that they had committed illegal activity on their computer. Paying a “fine” allowed them to work again.

The first mainstream piece of ransomware was CryptoLocker, discovered in the fall of 2013. Similar to PC Cyborg Trojan, it encrypted hard drives and demanded $300 within a certain timeframe or the files would be lost forever. At its peak, CryptoLocker infected over 150,000 computers a month.

**The Coming of CryptoWall**

Now the current ransomware threat is something called CryptoWall. It usually targets Windows machines and spreads through virus tactics like phishing. It tricks users into infecting their systems by opening a malicious email attachment and then demands a payment ranging from $500 to $1000 per workstation. These payments are made using a virtual currency called Bitcoin and pass through an anonymous network of servers, which makes tracking them nearly impossible.

CryptoWall’s scope is staggering. Between March and August of 2014, Dell SecureWorks logged about 625,000 infections, more than 250,000 of which were in the US alone[5]. Some of the phishing emails told recipients that an update was available for their Google Chrome browser. Other systems were infected by malicious “resume attachments” embedded into phony job applications.

**Is Your Practice At Risk?**

As the CEO of an IT services company, I’ve personally witnessed the results of a CryptoWall infection. In fact, I can relate two incidents that perfectly illustrate what happens when businesses don’t take precautionary measures.

The first involved a dental office that had just signed up with us. As is the typical situation when we get new customers, this practice never had a comprehensive backup strategy. We immediately initiated backups of all their servers and workstations. Unfortunately, we came on to the scene literally hours before their office became the target of a CryptoWall attack.

This office used Windows Remote Desktop in conjunction with 15 computers, and this particular attack exploited the ability to connect remotely. The infection hit while we were still in the process of backing everything up. The result? A significant number of systems became infected and unusable. Since the business needed their data and they had no previous backups, there was no choice but to pay the $570 ransom and wait for a “code” to be sent. Thankfully, the code eventually arrived and the data was recovered, but the process of purchasing the Bitcoin, wiring it to the specified address, and then waiting for the code to be delivered took a total of 5 days. Can you effectively run your practice without access to patient records or payroll information for 5 days?

We had another encounter with CryptoWall when a client's office manager opened a PDF that turned out to be a CryptoWall phishing attack. Her computer and others in the office became infected and displayed the typical ransom message. However, because this business was an established customer, they had the benefit of hourly backups of their workstations and data. We performed a quick restore to a snapshot that was saved an hour before the attack. Overall, this customer only lost an hour’s worth of data and productivity and did not have to pay the ransom. Five days versus one hour. An ounce of prevention …

Fortunately, there are things you can do now to protect yourself from ransomware, and none of it is particularly new. It just requires you to be proactive.

**Three Steps to Protect Your Dental Office**

1. **Train your team to surf safely.** This granddaddy of computing advice still protects you against the new threat of ransomware. Today’s computer systems have come a long way in securing themselves against attacks. What they can’t do is protect themselves from their users. Train your staff to not open unexpected email attachments — even if it’s for something as innocent as an unexpected job application. And definitely tell them not to click on any ads or popups while browsing the internet.
2. **Set up a Super Firewall.** You hopefully have an IT administrator/provider that looks after your computer systems (hint: if you don’t have one, you should really get one). Have them upgrade your standard firewall with one that can block potentially dangerous websites or that can restrict any non-work-related websites your staff can access.
3. **Establish a solid backup strategy.** The biggest headache with today’s ransomware is that they encrypt your files. The only way to avoid paying the ransom is to completely restore your system from a clean, recent backup. Your IT provider should have an automated backup procedure that’s transparent and comprehensive. Make sure the number of backups they keep is over a long period of time. 

Even though ransomware is a scary new threat to your business, you have tools available to minimize your risk. Sit down regularly and evaluate your practice’s IT policies. Don’t have a certified IT administrator/service provider? There are plenty out there that are willing to help you. Is your current IT lead unsure about how to implement strategies to combat the latest threats? Get that person educated or look for a new provider who's serious about protecting your business.

We all know that dental problems can start small and, if not treated properly, cause intense pain and thousands of dollars. That same philosophy applies to your business. Look at your practice like you would any patient coming to see you: be proactive about its health and investigate ways to keep it safe, healthy, and smiling.
