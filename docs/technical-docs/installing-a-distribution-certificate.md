# Installing a Distribution Certificate

1. Locate the CER file you saved in your Distribution Files folder.
2. Double-click the file. It will open the Keychain Access application.
3. A window containing the CER file will appear. It will have the name "iPhone Distribution <firstname> <lastname>" and will expire one year from today's date.<br /><br />

| *Distribution certificates must be renewed yearly in order to submit new apps or app updates. An expired distribution certificate will not affect any existing apps in the Apple App Store.*|
