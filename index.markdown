# Welcome!

My name is Victor Cardoso and I'm an experienced leader, technical writer, and product education specialist. I have a passion for creating content that explains software systems to end-users (whether they are consumers, salespeople, or developers).

This is my GitHub site. I'm using it to showcase my writing portfolio. Use the navigation bar to see examples of my marketing docs, technical docs, and miscellaneous projects.

You can learn more about my work history and skillset on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorcardoso/).
